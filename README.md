# Developed Fire Risk Model for Joshua Tree National Park  
### Analyzing desert fire trends using open-source 10 m Sentinel-2 NDVI time series  

My workflow offers land managers a repeatable method to monitor fine-fuel accumulation and detect high-risk fire conditions in arid landscapes.

## **Overview**

Wildfires in Joshua Tree National Park have increased with the spread of invasive annual grasses such as **Red Brome**, **Cheatgrass**, and **Split Grass**. These grasses form continuous fine-fuel beds that persist on the landscape for years, allowing fire to carry through otherwise sparse desert vegetation.

This project analyzes five years of **Sentinel-2 NDVI data (2019–2023)** to identify vegetation stress patterns that preceded the **2022 Elk Fire**.

## **Key Goals**

- **Quantify conditions that create peak wildfire risk** in Joshua Tree National Park so land managers can identify high-risk years and justify funding for fuel breaks and proactive mitigation.  
- **Advance understanding of desert fire ecology** by documenting how wet-year biomass growth followed by multi-year drying (“curing”) creates the highest potential for fire spread.
